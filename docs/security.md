# Security Considerations

## Authentication & Authorization
- Authentication uses environment secrets for secure token storage:
  ```bash
  wrangler secret put AUTH_TOKEN
  ```
- Implements timing-safe comparison to prevent timing attacks
- Secure KV namespace ID storage using secrets:
  ```bash
  wrangler secret put KV_LINKS_PRODUCTION_ID
  ```

## Data Protection
- Uses strict URL validation to prevent malicious redirects
- Enforces HTTPS-only URLs to prevent insecure communications
- Validates URLs again before redirecting to prevent stored XSS attacks
- Stores metadata with each URL for audit trails
- Secure data separation between development and production environments

## Web Security Headers
- Content Security Policy (CSP): `default-src 'self'`
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS): Enforces HTTPS connections
- X-Content-Type-Options: Prevents MIME-type sniffing
- X-Frame-Options: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- Referrer-Policy: Controls information in HTTP Referer header
- Permissions-Policy: Restricts browser feature usage

## Infrastructure
- Domain-specific origin restrictions for enhanced security
- Proper CORS configuration to prevent cross-origin attacks
- Cryptographically strong ID generation for shortened URLs
- Error logging with minimal information disclosure
- Separate preview/production KV namespaces
